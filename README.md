![BusinessLight](http://www.martinobordin.it/businesslight.png) Light framework for speed up writing .NET Line of Business (LOB) applications

## What is
- Entities, Value objects and common types for model your data
- Repository, Unit of Work and Query object abstraction (implementation with EntityFramework and InMemory)
- Mapping abstraction (implementation with Automapper)
